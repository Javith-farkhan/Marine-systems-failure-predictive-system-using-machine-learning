# Marine-systems-failure-predictive-system-using-machine-learning

## Small Description

The integration of a machine learning model within a marine systems monitoring framework, aimed at predicting potential failures in ship components to enhance maintenance planning and reduce operational risks.

## About

Marine Systems Failure Predictive System Using Machine Learning is designed to predict failures in marine systems using advanced machine learning techniques. Traditional maintenance practices rely on periodic inspections or reactive responses to failures, leading to inefficiencies and potential safety risks. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a predictive system that analyzes sensor data from ship components, identifies patterns, and forecasts possible failures before they occur.

## Features

Implements advanced machine learning models for failure prediction.

A framework-based application for real-time deployment.

High scalability for various marine system components.

Low computational complexity for real-time performance.

Uses structured JSON data format for model training and predictions.

## Requirements

Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10, Ubuntu) for compatibility with machine learning frameworks.

Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for model development and deployment.

Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for training predictive models.

Data Processing Libraries: Pandas and NumPy for handling sensor data efficiently.

Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.

IDE: Use of VSCode or Jupyter Notebook for coding, debugging, and visualization.

Additional Dependencies: Includes Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, along with SciPy for statistical analysis.
